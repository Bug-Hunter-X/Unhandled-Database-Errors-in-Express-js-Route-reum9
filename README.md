# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling when interacting with databases.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The original code lacks proper error handling for database operations, resulting in generic error messages to the client and potential vulnerabilities.

**Solution:** The solution implements comprehensive error handling to catch database errors, provide informative messages to the client, and log errors for debugging purposes.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the buggy code: `node bug.js`
4. Run the solution code: `node bugSolution.js`

Observe the difference in error handling and response messages.
